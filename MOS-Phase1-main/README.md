This is my Operating System Course Project

A Virtual Implemention of routines of OS.

This is a first Phase of MOS

This Code Written in the C++ Only.

## MOS(Multiprogramming Operating System)
 - Used for execution of multiple jobs
 - Job should be defined ,well structured.
 - System Will Report Error ,For Wrong Jobs With Proper Error Messages.
 - Series of Jobs should be kept in input.txt.
 - Afer processing of jobs output can be seen output.txt
 - Random memory allocation for program card used using paging.

## Job can consist of Instruction
 - GD-Get Data
 - PD-Print Data
 - LR-Load Register From Memory
 - SR-Store Register From Memory
 - CR-Compare Register And Memory
 - BT-Branch Toggle(Checks Toggle Variable)
 - H- Denotes end of job.
 - Job should start with $AMJ
 - There is $DTA after declaration of program cards and before data cards
 - Job should end with $END
## Tools used
 - Gcc c++ compiler
  

## Usingâ€¦
 1. git clone https://github.com/Prajwalpal10/MOS-Phase1.git

 2. Edit input.txt for Your Instruction &Jobs.
 3. Compile And Run The Mos_Phase-1.cpp
 4. And Enjoy :) .
